# Tandem — context for the agent

Read this before touching anything. This file exists so that a fresh session can
pick the work back up without re-paying for discoveries that were expensive the
first time.

## What it is

A `.deb` package that makes `.exe`, `.msi`, `.apk` and `.xapk` open with a
**double click** on Linux. It is not a prefix manager and not a Bottles
replacement: it is a **thin layer of decision, translation and diagnosis** on top
of `wine`, `winetricks -q` and `waydroid`.

The target user is not a programmer. The quality bar is: *no error path may end
in silence.* "I double-clicked and nothing happened" is treated as a bug, not as
a limitation.

## Inviolable rules

1. **Never write into a Wine prefix Tandem did not create.** Our prefixes carry
   the `.tandem-prefixo` marker. Any other one is read-only to the automation:
   Tandem runs the program inside it, reports what is missing, and **stops**.
   This exists because the origin machine also runs a point-of-sale system in
   its own prefix — installing a dependency inside a working production
   environment is worse than not automating at all.
2. **User-facing messages in Portuguese, no jargon.** `NO_MATCHING_ABIS` becomes
   "este app é feito só para celular e não roda aqui".
3. **`set -e` only in the packager, never in the executables.** The wait loops
   depend on commands that fail on purpose (`grep -q ... && break`).
4. **Never repeat an install already paid for.** `dotnet48` takes ~30 min; the
   receipt lives in `$WINEPREFIX/.tandem-verbos`.
5. **The packager must not depend on `dpkg-deb`.** `build.py` writes the `ar`
   archive by hand and runs on any OS, Windows included.

## Language of the repository

**Everything written in this repository is in English** — comments, test names,
documentation, the changelog, and commit messages. That is a standing directive:
the repository is where people from outside come to read and contribute, and a
codebase they cannot read is a wall.

Four deliberate exceptions, all of them for the same reason — the product's user
is a Brazilian shop owner who is not a programmer:

1. **Every string shown to the user stays in Portuguese.** That is rule №2 above
   and it is a product requirement, not a preference. It covers whatever goes to
   `t_erro`, `t_aviso`, `t_ok`, `t_pergunta`, `t_texto`, `zenity`, and the help
   text in `uso()`.
2. **The command names the user types stay in Portuguese** — `preparar`,
   `programas`, `desinstalar`, `dados`, `alternativas`, `receita`, `memoria`,
   `esquecer`, `socorro`, `contribuir`, `lista`. Most carry an English alias for
   people who expect one.
3. **Anything shipped inside the package stays in Portuguese**, because it is
   product, not repository: `man/tandem.1` (the user reads it with `man
   tandem`), the `Name`/`Comment` fields of the `.desktop` files, and the
   `xml:lang="pt_BR"` comments in `src/mime/tandem.xml`.
4. **`LEIAME.md` and `CONTRIBUINDO.md` stay in Portuguese.** They are the front
   door for the audience that actually runs this software, and a test keeps
   their command lists in sync with the English pair.

The short form: **the repository is English, the product is Portuguese.**

And one thing that only looks like language: **the literal values written into
state files** — `abriu`, `confirmado`, `so-abriu`, `reprovado`, `RESOLVERAM`,
`NAO_RESOLVERAM`, `CONFIANCA`, `alta`, `baixa`, `override`, `titulo`, `ambos`,
`nativo`, `parecido`. Those are on-disk format, not prose. Translating one
silently breaks compatibility with memory files and recipes already written on
someone's machine.

Commands (`tandem --help` is the source of truth):

```
install    programas   desinstalar   preparar     android
doctor     autoteste   repair        backup       restore      dados
protect    alternativas  receita     memoria      esquecer     logs

```

Build and verify:

```bash
python3 build.py --check
bash tests/run.sh          # 309 tests, no Wine, no Waydroid, no install
```

The suite sources the libraries straight from `src/lib` and generates synthetic
Android packages with a real binary `AndroidManifest.xml` (`tests/mkapk.py`), so
the manifest reader is exercised on the same code path a real APK takes. An
absent optional tool is skipped, not failed. **Run it before committing.**

## How the dependency detector works

Wine writes `err:module:import_dll Library MSVCP140.dll not found` when a library
is missing. `t_verbos_do_log` reads those lines, ignores DLLs Wine implements
itself (`kernel32`, `user32`…) and translates the rest into winetricks verbs. A
DLL with no known translation is **not** a system dependency — it is a file the
program itself should have shipped, and the message says so.

Test it without needing Wine:

```bash
. src/lib/winedeps.sh
printf '0:err:module:import_dll Library MSVCP140.dll (needed by X) not found\n' > /tmp/w.log
t_verbos_do_log /tmp/w.log     # expects: vcrun2022
```

## Ecosystem facts already established (do not re-research)

- **No project does automatic dependency detection for `.exe`.** Not Bottles,
  not Lutris, not PlayOnLinux — all of them require a human picking from a list.
  Tandem's loop is new work; calibrate your expectations of its hit rate.
- **Bottles cannot install dependencies from the command line** (GUI only),
  which rules it out as an engine.
- **Tandem enters an association dispute, not a vacuum.** Zorin 18 ships
  "Windows App Support" and Waydroid installs `waydroid.app.install.desktop`. If
  a double click opens an "Open with…" dialog, that is why — run `tandem repair`,
  which shows who held the type before and after.
- **`~/.config/gnome-mimeapps.list` and `zorin-mimeapps.list` outrank**
  `mimeapps.list` and override it silently. `tandem-repair` clears the
  competitors, with a backup.
- **`waydroid app install` returns 0 even when it fails.** Always parse the
  output.
- **`Session: RUNNING` does not mean Android is ready.** Wait for
  `sys.boot_completed`; with GAPPS that is another 20–60 s.
- **`winemenubuilder` does two things.** It creates menu shortcuts (we want
  that) and hijacks `.txt`/`.jpg`/`.pdf` associations (we do not). Disabling the
  binary kills both; the right key is
  `HKCU\Software\Wine\FileOpenAssociations\Enable = N`.
- **`WINEARCH` only at prefix creation.** Setting it on an existing prefix makes
  Wine refuse to start.
- **`.msi` is not a PE.** `wine file.msi` always fails; it has to be
  `wine msiexec /i`.
- **zenity refuses accented text when the locale does not exist.** Setting a
  locale the system never generated (`LC_ALL=pt_BR.UTF-8` on a Zorin installed in
  English) makes glib fall back to `ANSI_X3.4-1968`; from then on any non-ASCII
  argument returns `This option is not available`, exit 255, and **no window
  appears at all**. Since every message here has accents, that erased the entire
  interface in silence. Reliable detector: `locale charmap` must say `UTF-8`. Use
  `t_locale_utf8`, never hard-code a locale.
- **`zenity --error` blocks until the click** and returns 0. A non-zero return
  means the window was never shown — that is the signal `t_erro` uses to decide
  whether it needs to repeat the message on the terminal.
- **A progress pipe opened write-only kills the process.** When zenity went
  away, the next progress message took SIGPIPE and brought the whole of Tandem
  down: exit 141, nothing in the log. Inside the `winetricks` loop that cut an
  install in half. Opening the descriptor with `exec 8<> fifo` fixes it — with
  both ends open the pipe never runs out of readers.
- **An `exec N> file` that fails does not abort bash.** The script stays alive,
  `flock` answers "Bad file descriptor", and mistaking that for "lock taken" made
  the double click die in silence. An impossible lock and a busy lock are
  different cases: in the first, carry on without a lock.
- **`wine uninstaller --list` lies.** A 32-bit installer writes its key under
  `Wow6432Node\...\Uninstall`, and `uninstaller.exe` — which becomes a 32-bit
  process when `wine32` is present — enumerates the other view. Confirmed with
  real Wine: 7-Zip installed, list empty. Read `system.reg` and `user.reg`
  directly; both views show up, and you do not even need Wine to list them.
- **GNOME under Wayland does not re-read the application list.** A new
  `.desktop` in a freshly created subfolder (`applications/wine/Programs/X/`)
  only appears in the menu after logging out and back in.
  `update-desktop-database` does **not** fix it — tested on the real machine.
  That is why `tandem programas` exists: Tandem cannot depend on the system menu
  for you to find what you installed.
- **You cannot install dependencies from `postinst`.** `dpkg` holds a lock while
  it runs; an `apt-get` in there waits forever. Hence `tandem preparar` being a
  separate command.
- **`[ -t 1 ]` alone does not distinguish a double click from a redirect.** A
  pipe and a file are not terminals either, and sending the diagnosis to a window
  made `tandem doctor > report.txt` write zero bytes. Test all three:
  `[ -t 1 ] || [ -p /dev/fd/1 ] || [ -f /dev/fd/1 ]`.
- **`exec` WITHOUT A COMMAND applies its redirections to the whole shell, and
  permanently.** Written as `exec 7> file 2>/dev/null`, that `2>/dev/null` does
  not silence the `exec`: it silences stderr for **all the rest of the program**.
  Measured on an Ubuntu 24.04 with no graphical session: the loop detected the
  right DLL, translated it correctly, assembled the correct message with the
  correct command — and returned exit 53 with **zero bytes** of output. It was
  hiding inside the code written to fix a silent failure. The correct form is
  `{ exec 7> file; } 2>/dev/null`: the descriptor persists, the redirect dies at
  the end of the group.
- **Arriving is not arriving in the right bitness.** In a `win64` prefix,
  `system32` holds the 64-bit DLLs and `syswow64` the 32-bit ones. The `mfc42`
  verb exits 0 and delivers into `syswow64`; a 64-bit program still cannot find
  it. The v3.3 delivery proof looked in both folders and approved — a dead end
  with a receipt on top. Check **per architecture**. Half the winetricks verbs
  ship 32-bit payloads only, and it says so in English in the middle of the log.
- **`systemd-inhibit` exists and does not work without D-Bus.** It exits 1 and
  takes the wrapped command down with it; `winetricks` never even ran. Exercise
  it before using it (`t_inibidor`), do not ask whether the binary exists.
- **`t_texto` reads its content from STANDARD INPUT**; the argument is only the
  window title. Passing the text as the argument makes the command run, exit 0
  and print nothing — it happened to five commands at once, and no test caught it
  because every test exercised libraries, never a whole command. There is a test
  now that runs each command and demands output.
- **`winetricks -q` exiting 0 does not mean the file arrived.** It reports that
  *it* finished. With a wrong entry in the table, the verb installed something
  else, exited 0, and the receipt was written exactly as for a correct install —
  and a receipt is permanent under rule №4. On the next attempt Tandem said "I
  already installed what this program was asking for" and gave up, with the real
  cause untouched. Since 3.3 there is delivery proof: the requested DLL is
  checked in `system32`/`syswow64` before the receipt is written. **Absence of
  proof does not condemn** — only a proven contradiction holds the receipt back,
  because not every verb delivers a same-named DLL.
- **The executables honour `TANDEM_LIB`** when locating the libraries
  (`. "${TANDEM_LIB:-/usr/lib/tandem}/common.sh"`). With the path hard-coded
  there was no way to exercise the run→detect→install loop without installing the
  package, and the whole suite stopped at the library level.
- **Waydroid is not in the Ubuntu/Zorin repositories.** `apt-cache policy
  waydroid` answers `Candidate: (none)`. It comes from `repo.waydro.id`, with a
  signing key.

## State

Verified **on real Linux** (Ubuntu 24.04 noble, the same base as Zorin 18, with
root), no longer only by reading:

- The `.deb` written by hand by `build.py` is accepted by a real `dpkg`:
  `dpkg-deb --info/--contents`, `dpkg -i`, `dpkg --configure`. It installs,
  configures and uninstalls. Reproducible build (two builds, same cksum).
- `lintian` clean: zero errors, zero warnings.
- `postinst` on the per-user path: it protected, on its own, the three
  pre-existing Wine prefixes (`~/.wine`, `~/.wine-pdv`, `wineprefixes/*`).
  **Rule №1 confirmed end to end.**
- `tandem-repair` against a competing `gnome-mimeapps.list`: it removed the
  disputed entries, preserved someone else's `text/plain`, wrote to
  `mimeapps.list`, and left a backup.
- `tandem doctor`, `version`, `--help`, the panel with no GUI: all produce
  output.
- zenity windows really do open (verified under Xvfb), accents included.
- Real Wine installed in the container: a `win64` prefix created from scratch,
  7-Zip x64 installed from both `.exe` and `.msi`, registry inspected by hand.
- **The run→detect→install loop closed successfully with real tools.** A
  hand-forged 32-bit PE importing `mfc42.dll` (a DLL Wine does not implement,
  cross-checked against `objdump` before use): detected, installed, the DLL
  landed in `syswow64`, the bitness matched, the second attempt exited 0, memory
  recorded `RESOLVERAM=mfc42` and `CONFIRMADO=sim`, and the recipe came out
  marked `CONFIANCA=confirmado`. The same test with a 64-bit PE produced the
  bitness dead end and the message that explains it.
- `tandem dados` listing and copying real files out of a prefix; `tandem socorro`
  producing its report; the bitness warning appearing in the dialog *before* the
  download.
- 309 automated tests in `tests/run.sh`; CI on GitHub Actions.

Verified **on the user's Zorin 18.1** (Wayland, Wine 10.0, Waydroid active):

- `tandem doctor` complete, with the whole environment present.
- The two pre-existing prefixes (`~/.wine` and `~/.wine-pdv`, the POS one) were
  protected **on their own** on first run, without typing anything.
- Double click routing: `xdg-mime query default` answers `tandem-exe.desktop`
  and `tandem-apk.desktop`.
- 7-Zip x64 installed by Tandem: prefix created, installer executed, `.lnk` in
  the Start Menu, `winemenubuilder` generating the `.desktop`.
- **The user's file associations survived intact** — `zip`, `txt`, `jpeg` and
  `pdf` still belong to the Zorin apps, no `wine-extension` anywhere. That is the
  proof of the decision to disable only the hijack via the
  `FileOpenAssociations` key rather than `winemenubuilder` as a whole.
- The accented error window really appears, with the right text.

**Still unverified — needs the real machine:** `pkexec` and the polkit rule (the
Waydroid service was already active, so the rule was never exercised), XAPK
installation on a real Waydroid, and the newer commands `preparar`, `programas`,
`desinstalar`, `dados` and `socorro` in the field.

Reference environment where the project was born: Zorin OS 18.1 (Ubuntu noble
base), kernel 7.0, x86_64, Wayland/GNOME, 15 GB RAM, Wine 10.0 from the distro
repository, Waydroid 1.6.2 MAINLINE with GAPPS and libhoudini, `binderfs` with
`anbox-*` nodes.

## What was built after 2.1

- **Pre-flight** (`peinfo.py`): reads the `.exe` import table without executing
  it. Validated against `objdump` on 37 real binaries — identical output on all
  37.
- **Impossibility verdict** (`limites.tsv`): recognises protection dongles,
  system drivers and direct USB BEFORE running. It does not block; it explains
  the failure.
- **The winetricks index** (`verbos.tsv`, 274 DLLs): generated from each verb's
  `w_override_dlls` and, since 3.4, from the DLL list in `title=` as well. It
  only answers with high confidence. Used above all as an AUDITOR of the
  hand-written table, and in that role it found **six mapping errors** that were
  installing the wrong thing and writing a receipt for it.
- **Memory and recipes**: what each program asked for, keyed by the FILE (size +
  first and last MiB), so the lesson survives moving folders and holds on another
  machine. A recipe is a text file the owner sends to someone. It only pulls,
  never pushes.
- **Delivery proof** (3.3): the receipt requires evidence that the DLL arrived,
  and since 3.4 that the bitness matches.
- **`tandem dados`** (3.4): environment separated from data, with a copy taken
  before every destructive path.
- **Silent success** (3.4): `exit 0` stopped meaning "it worked"; the owner is
  asked once, and the recipe carries where its confidence came from.
- **The community list** (3.4): the ad-blocker filter-list model. Down is
  automatic; up is the owner's decision.
- **`tandem autoteste`**: exercises instead of listing. Where it cannot
  exercise, it says it skipped.
- **`tandem preparar`**, **`programas`**, **`desinstalar`**, **`alternativas`**,
  **`socorro`**, **`contribuir`**.
- **Evidence gate, CI and a release pipeline.**

## Next steps

The full idea ledger — the 52 ideas from both panels, each with a verdict, and
the rejected ones with the reason written down — lives in `docs/IDEAS.md`. Read
it before proposing anything new; half the obvious ideas were already turned down
for a reason.

The queue, in order:

1. **Fill the community list.** The mechanism exists and is empty. Inventing a
   line would be exactly the mistake the `confidence` field exists to prevent, so
   it only fills with reports from real people. `tandem contribuir` builds the
   line; the issue template receives it.
2. **A real shop program.** The loop has now worked end to end with real Wine and
   real `winetricks`, but against a forged `.exe` in a container. That proves the
   mechanism, not the product. It is still the project's largest uncertainty.
3. Field-test what has not run on the owner's machine yet: `preparar`,
   `desinstalar`, `dados`, `socorro`, and a double click on a real `.xapk`.
4. Publish the release. The workflow exists: `git tag v3.5 && git push origin
   v3.5` builds, tests, installs, purges and publishes with a checksum.
5. `.apkm` support is declared but only `.xapk`/`.apks` were tested.
6. Clone a prefix with .NET already in it instead of running `dotnet48` from
   scratch (30 min, high failure rate) — delivery proof was the prerequisite and
   now exists; what is missing is the care never to read from a protected prefix
   in use.

## Development machine environment

Windows. Working copy at `C:\tandem`. `git push` works because the GitHub
credential is already in the credential helper — **do not try to read the
credentials file** (it is blocked, and rightly so): just run `git push` and Git
uses it. This account's GitHub MCP integration is **read-only**:
`create_repository` and `push_files` return 403. Use `git` directly.
